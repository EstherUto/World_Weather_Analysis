## Overview of World Weather Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to assist a data analyst at a hotel and lodging company (hereby refered to as "client") to compile and present data that would be usuful to their customers in deciding travel itinerary. As part of this analysis, APIs were the major source of retrieving information. 

As API keys are sensitive information, users that would like to run the code would be required to create a `config.py` file, that has their API key,in the same folder as the `.ipynb` codes.

### Folder Information Summary

#### D1
The `Weather_Database` folder includes a `Weather_Database.ipynb` file that provides the reader with weather information on different cities using random numbers generated from the `numpy` package. The output was kept in the `WeatherPy_Database.csv` file.

#### D2
The `Vacation_Search` folder includes a `Vacation_Search.ipynb` file which makes use of the `WeatherPy_Database.csv` file that was generated in **D1**. The `WeatherPy_Database.csv` file was inputted, cleaned out of any possible N/As and NULLs and outputted into a `WeatherPy_vacation.csv` file. The user is also able to choose ther desired range of temperature in degree Fahrenheit (Â°F) to help narrow down potential destination locations.

All the data points were plotted using a marker on google maps using `gmaps.figure()`. As temperature is an important factor in choosing vacation and hotel destinations, a heat layer showing temperature intensity was also added onto the map.

#### D3
The `Vacation_Itinerary` folder includes a `Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb` file which makes use of the `WeatherPy_vacation.csv` file from **D2**. Four random cities in China were picked to show the usefullness of the code to deleiver a visual itinerary using google maps.

## Conclusion

The hope is this file would assist the client in building their user interface of the company customers.
